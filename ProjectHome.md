phpbb is a popular php forum application,  it's limited in function with many version to even supporting basic rss syndication.

I made an alpha version for slingshot forums, it was in part to learn php and how to build an rss feed.

I am looking at rebuilding on what I learned from the first version and am using the zend framework (which I am learning) to make an application for building an rss free from phpbb forum.

The first version didn't strip message body, it just showed, subject, editor, date.
To include the message body into the rss feed the amount of data mining increases like mad, if I was to use the code to rip message body and I did no checking to see if posts where old or what. It just build an rss feed on the forum/group front page.  It would miss posts and I only used it, because it worked and it was futile to fix to use on message posts.

It's also test of how do i make a google project, oh wiki's work and issues.

I hope to get 80% of the project up in august.
